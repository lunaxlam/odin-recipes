<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I was first introduced to soba noodles by my sister-in-law, who loves to make them with just tamari and green onion for seasoning. 
I like to use them in all kinds of vegan recipes, especially fresh salads with a flavorful dressing. 
Soba noodles are made with buckwheat, which is gluten-free and can be found in the Asian section of the grocery store, or Chinatown. 
The longer the dressing sits, the better it will be, so make it ahead of time if you can.</p>
